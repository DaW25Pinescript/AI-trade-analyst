# Trendlines Lens

**name:** chart-analysis-lens-trendlines  
**description:** Classic retail trendlines viewed through institutional liquidity lens (probabilistic, not absolute).

## Rules
- Draw only on **3+ clean touches** of swing points (body or wick).  
- Anchor to confirmed swing highs/lows.  
- **Trendlines act as liquidity pools** — sweeps are common (especially near session pivots or HTF PD arrays).  
- **True breaks** are possible when accompanied by: displacement + BOS/MSS in the break direction + follow-through close.  
- On sweep: expect reversion into nearest PD array or FVG before continuation.

## Analysis Steps
1. Identify all visible retail trendlines.  
2. Note touches, slope, and whether price is approaching/testing.  
3. Classify as “likely liquidity” or “potential real break” with reasoning.  
4. Confluence with other lenses.
