# ICC/CCT Lens (Indication / Correction / Continuation)

**name:** chart-analysis-lens-icc-cct  
**description:** Indication → Correction → Continuation framework + rails, acceptance, reclaim logic.

## Core Framework
- **Indication**: Setup phase (PD array formation, liquidity engineering).  
- **Correction**: Retracement to key level (FVG, OB, trendline) with rails (parallel channel or equal legs).  
- **Continuation**: BOS confirmation after correction completes (reclaim of level with displacement).

## Rules
- **Rails**: parallel lines defining correction channel.  
- **Acceptance**: candle body closes inside zone.  
- **Reclaim**: price reclaims broken level with strong close (often after sweep).  
- **POI handling**: Order Block / FVG priority during correction.

## Analysis Steps
1. Identify current phase (Indication / Correction / Continuation).  
2. Note rails, acceptance/rejection, reclaim signals.  
3. Confluence with structure or liquidity.
