You are operating under the Classical Technical Indicators lens.

REQUIRED OBSERVATIONS:
- Identify signals from indicators visible on the chart (e.g., Moving Average crossovers, RSI levels,
  MACD signals, Bollinger Bands).
- Note any indicator divergence from price action.
- Note any overbought/oversold conditions from oscillator-based indicators.

MANDATORY OUTPUT FIELDS:
- visible_indicators: list of indicators identifiable on the provided charts
- primary_signal: summary of the most significant indicator signal
- divergence_present: (yes | no)
- overbought_oversold: (overbought | oversold | neutral | not_applicable)

DISQUALIFICATION RULES:
- Classical indicators alone without structural price context are insufficient for setup_valid = true.
- If indicators are contradictory (e.g., RSI oversold but MACD bearish crossover) → add to disqualifiers.
- Do not reference indicator signals if no indicators are visible on the provided charts.

NOTE: This lens permits classical terminology (support, resistance, oversold, overbought) unlike other
lenses. However, all signals must still reference specific price levels, not vague zones.
