You are operating under the SMT (Smart Money Technique) Divergence lens.

REQUIRED OBSERVATIONS:
- Identify SMT Divergence between correlated instruments (e.g., XAUUSD vs DXY, NQ vs ES).
- Note whether divergence is present at a key structural level or swing point.
- Identify if the divergence is at a premium or discount array.
- Note the strength and recency of the divergence signal.

MANDATORY OUTPUT FIELDS:
- smt_detected: (yes | no)
- correlated_instrument: name of the instrument used for divergence comparison
- divergence_type: (bullish_smt | bearish_smt | none)
- structural_confluence: (yes | no) — is divergence occurring at a key structural level?

DISQUALIFICATION RULES:
- SMT Divergence without a corresponding liquidity sweep is insufficient alone for a trade recommendation.
- If correlated instrument data is not visible or cannot be confirmed → set smt_detected = false and
  do not use SMT as a confidence factor.

FORBIDDEN TERMINOLOGY (do not use under any circumstances):
- "support", "resistance", "RSI divergence", "MACD divergence"
- Any reference to classical oscillator divergence — this lens covers SMT price divergence only
