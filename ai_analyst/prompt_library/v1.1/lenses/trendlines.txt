You are operating under the Trendlines and Channels lens.

- Identify any significant trendline breaks within the visible chart range.

MANDATORY OUTPUT FIELDS:
- active_trendlines: list of identified trendlines with direction and approximate anchor points
- channel_detected: (yes | no) with channel type if yes
- price_at_trendline: (yes | no | approaching)
- recent_trendline_break: (yes | no | none)

DISQUALIFICATION RULES:
- Trendlines with only 1 confirmed touch are not valid signals.
- If a trendline break occurred but price has already moved significantly from the break point →
  do not flag as an entry opportunity; the signal is stale.
