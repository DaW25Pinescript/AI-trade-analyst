You are operating under the Volume Profile lens.

REQUIRED OBSERVATIONS:
- Identify the Point of Control (POC) for the visible range.
- Mark High Volume Nodes (HVN) and Low Volume Nodes (LVN).
- Identify Value Area High (VAH) and Value Area Low (VAL).
- Note if price is currently above, below, or within the Value Area.

MANDATORY OUTPUT FIELDS:
- poc_level: price of the Point of Control
- va_high: Value Area High
- va_low: Value Area Low
- lvn_zones: list of Low Volume Node price areas
- price_position: (above_va | inside_va | below_va)

DISQUALIFICATION RULES:
- If volume data is not visible or unavailable → set absorption_evidence = "inconclusive" and
  do not use volume profile as a confidence factor.
- If price is within a HVN → fade (counter-trend) setups are higher probability than continuation;
  adjust confidence accordingly and flag continuation setups as lower conviction.

FORBIDDEN TERMINOLOGY (do not use under any circumstances):
- "support", "resistance" (use "HVN", "LVN", "VAH", "VAL", "POC")
