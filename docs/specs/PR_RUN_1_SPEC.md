# AI Trade Analyst — PR-RUN-1: Run Browser Endpoint + Frontend Spec

**Status:** ⏳ Spec drafted — implementation pending
**Date:** 15 March 2026
**Repo:** `github.com/DaW25Pinescript/AI-trade-analyst`
**Branch:** `pr-run-1-run-browser`
**Phase:** PR-RUN-1 (Phase 8, Week 1)
**Depends on:** Phase 7 complete (PR-OPS-5b merged, 63 frontend tests, 197 backend tests)

---

## 1. Purpose

**After:** Phase 7 (Agent Ops read-side stack — roster, health, trace, detail endpoints + frontend wiring). Phases 1–7 complete.

**Question this phase answers:** Can a user discover and select analysis runs from the UI without knowing the run_id in advance?

**From → To:**

- **From:** Run mode requires manual paste of a known `run_id`. Operator must have the run_id from logs, terminal output, or memory. No browsable run history exists in the UI.
- **To:** Run Browser panel lists recent runs as a compact, paginated, filterable index. Clicking a run loads its trace in Agent Ops Run mode. The paste-field becomes a fallback, not the primary entry point.

This PR is a **run index only**. It is not an artifact browser, trace replacement, or reflective surface. That scope lock remains correct from the Phase 8 plan.

**Router ownership note:** `GET /runs/` is a **top-level run-discovery surface**, not an ops endpoint. It is consumed first by Agent Ops Run mode, and later potentially by charts and reflect. This is why it lives in its own `routers/runs.py`, not in `routers/ops.py`. The existing `GET /runs/{run_id}/agent-trace` remains the run-scoped ops trace surface — separate concern, separate router.

---

## 2. Scope

### In scope

- `GET /runs/` backend endpoint — paginated, sorted, filterable run index
- Run browser projection service — reads `run_record.json` from disk, projects compact browser summaries from the real artifact shape
- `RunBrowserPanel` frontend component — replaces the paste-field as the primary run selector in Agent Ops Run mode
- Click-to-load: selecting a run in the browser loads its trace via the existing `GET /runs/{run_id}/agent-trace` endpoint
- Retain the paste-field as a secondary/fallback input (not removed, demoted)
- Contract tests for the new endpoint
- Frontend component tests for the browser panel

### Target components

| Layer | Component | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Backend | `GET /runs/` endpoint | Serve paginated run index |
| Backend | Run browser projection service | Scan directories, read `run_record.json`, project compact summaries |
| Frontend | `RunBrowserPanel` | Browsable run list with filters |
| Frontend | Agent Ops Run mode | Wire browser panel as primary run selector |

### Out of scope (hard list)

- No artifact content in browser response — no analyst results, no arbiter detail text, no stage traces. The trace endpoint handles that.
- No new persistence layer — no SQLite, no database, no index file. Read-side directory scan only.
- No new top-level module — work confined to existing `ai_analyst/api/` (backend) and `ui/` (frontend) packages
- No full-text search over run artifacts
- No sort toggles beyond newest-first default
- No run deletion, mutation, or lifecycle management — read-only projection
- No scheduler integration — endpoint reads stored data, does not trigger new analysis runs
- No chart or reflective features — those are PR-CHART-1+ and PR-REFLECT-1+
- No WebSocket / SSE / live-push — polling only, consistent with Phase 7 contract
- No changes to the existing trace, detail, roster, or health endpoints
- No changes to `run_record.json` artifact format — the browser adapts to the existing shape
- No reshaping of stored artifacts for browser convenience
- No artifact preview or download in the browser
- No reflect data aggregation — that is PR-REFLECT-1+
- No refactoring of trace service or unification of run-reading logic into a shared framework

---

## 3. Repo-Aligned Assumptions

| Area | Assumption |
|------|-----------|
| Run storage | Runs stored at `ai_analyst/output/runs/{run_id}/run_record.json` — confirmed by Phase 7 trace work |
| Run path utility | `ai_analyst/core/run_paths.py` provides `get_run_dir(run_id)` |
| `run_id` | Top-level field in `run_record.json` |
| `timestamp` | Top-level field in `run_record.json` |
| `instrument` | Nested at `request.instrument` |
| `session` | Nested at `request.session` |
| `arbiter` | Block containing `ran` (boolean), `verdict` (string), and other fields |
| Error/warning signals | Top-level `errors[]`, `warnings[]`, `analysts_failed[]`, `analysts_skipped[]` arrays |
| Stage tracking | Top-level `stages[]` array — each entry has `stage`, `status`, `duration_ms`; status is `"ok"` or `"failed"` |
| Run status | No guaranteed clean top-level status field — derived in projection layer |
| Run directory on disk | Currently empty (only `.gitkeep` and `_dev_diagnostics.jsonl`) — all tests must use temp dirs with fixture data |
| Fixture file | `tests/fixtures/sample_run_record.json` — confirmed representative artifact |
| Backend package | `ai_analyst/api/` (not `app/` — `app/` is legacy frontend JS) |
| Frontend workspace path | `ui/src/workspaces/ops/components/` (not `ui/src/components/ops/`) |
| Shared hooks/api | `ui/src/shared/hooks/` and `ui/src/shared/api/` |
| Frontend stack | React + TypeScript + Tailwind + TanStack Query — same as Phase 6/7 |
| Existing Run mode | Agent Ops Run mode uses a `RunSelector` paste-field component (PR-OPS-5b) with `onSelectRun(runId)` callback |
| Vite proxy | `/runs` proxy already configured in `ui/vite.config.ts` |

### Current likely state

The `run_record.json` artifact was designed during Obs Phase 1 and consumed by the Phase 7 trace endpoint (`ai_analyst/api/services/ops_trace.py`). The trace projection already parses `run_record.json` to extract participation, stages, and arbiter verdicts. The browser projection reads a strict subset of what trace already reads — it needs only the header-level identity, request context, and verdict summary.

The browser projection must NOT import or call the trace projection service. They read the same artifact but serve different purposes: trace does a deep read of one run, browser does a shallow read of many runs. No shared parsing helper should be extracted prematurely — if duplication becomes ugly later, that is a future TD item.

### Core question

Can we read the projection fields from `run_record.json` across a bounded set of run directories and project compact browser summaries without coupling to the trace projection internals?

## 5. Current State Audit Hypothesis

### What is already true

- `run_record.json` is produced by the analysis pipeline and consumed by the trace endpoint
- The trace projection already knows how to find and parse `run_record.json`
- Agent Ops Run mode exists with a paste-field `RunSelector` and full trace visualization
- The `OpsErrorEnvelope` pattern, `ResponseMeta` envelope, and `data_state` semantics are established conventions
- TanStack Query hooks pattern is established (useAgentRoster, useAgentHealth, useAgentTrace, useAgentDetail)
- The real artifact shape is confirmed: `run_id`, `timestamp` (top-level), `request.instrument`, `request.session`, `arbiter.ran`, `arbiter.verdict`, `stages[]`, `analysts[]`, `analysts_failed[]`, `analysts_skipped[]`, `warnings[]`, `errors[]`
- Trace service uses a three-value `run_status` policy: `completed | partial | failed`

### What likely remains incomplete

- No endpoint exists for listing multiple runs
- No projection service exists for extracting compact summaries across runs
- No frontend component exists for browsing/filtering runs

### Core phase question

Can the browser projection read the confirmed fields from 20–50+ run directories within acceptable latency, and can `run_status` be reliably derived from the error/arbiter/stage signals using the same three-state policy as trace?

---

## 6. Design

### 6.1 Backend — `GET /runs/` Endpoint Contract

**Route:** `GET /runs/`

This is a **top-level run-discovery surface**, registered in its own `routers/runs.py`. It is not an ops endpoint and must not be added to `routers/ops.py`.

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Constraint | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|------------|---------|
| `page` | `int` | `1` | ≥ 1 | Page number |
| `page_size` | `int` | `20` | 1–50 | Results per page |
| `instrument` | `string \| null` | `null` | Optional, exact match | Filter by instrument |
| `session` | `string \| null` | `null` | Optional, exact match | Filter by session |

Sort order is locked to **newest-first** by projected timestamp. No `sort` parameter in v1.

**Response shape:**

```typescript
type RunBrowserResponse = ResponseMeta & {
  items: RunBrowserItem[];
  page: number;
  page_size: number;
  total: number;
  has_next: boolean;
};

type RunBrowserItem = {
  run_id: string;
  timestamp: string;                // ISO 8601, from run_record top-level
  instrument: string | null;        // from request.instrument
  session: string | null;           // from request.session
  final_decision: string | null;    // from arbiter.verdict when arbiter.ran == true
  run_status: RunBrowserStatus;     // derived in projection layer
  trace_available: boolean;         // whether trace endpoint can operate on this run
};

type RunBrowserStatus = "completed" | "partial" | "failed";
```

> **Design note — `run_status` alignment:** The browser uses the same three-value policy as the trace service (`completed | partial | failed`). A fourth state (`unknown`) is reserved for future use only if real artifact diversity proves the three-state policy insufficient. Do not introduce it without a concrete failing test case.

**`ResponseMeta` fields** (inherited from Phase 7 convention):

| Field | Type | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| `version` | `string` | `"2026.03"` |
| `generated_at` | `string` | ISO 8601 timestamp of response generation |
| `data_state` | `"live" \| "stale" \| "unavailable"` | Response-level freshness — see §6.4 |

Note: `data_state` uses Phase 7's established vocabulary (`live | stale | unavailable`), not `fresh`, for cross-endpoint consistency.

**Error responses:**

| HTTP status | `error` code | When |
|------------|-------------|------|
| 500 | `RUN_SCAN_FAILED` | Run directory could not be scanned |
| 422 | `INVALID_FILTER` | Query parameter validation failure (e.g. `page_size=100`) |

Error responses use `OpsErrorEnvelope` shape, consistent with Phase 7 conventions.

### 6.2 Run Status Derivation Policy

`run_status` is derived deterministically from artifact signals, aligned with the trace service's existing three-value policy. It is never blindly copied from a non-existent top-level summary field.

**`completed`** — all of the following hold:

- run record parses successfully
- `errors` array is empty
- `arbiter.ran == true`
- `arbiter.verdict` is present
- no stage entry has status `"failed"`

**`partial`** — all of the following hold:

- run record parses successfully
- there is meaningful execution evidence (stages present, analysts present, or `arbiter.ran` exists)
- completion conditions above are NOT fully met
- the record is NOT clearly failed

Examples: arbiter did not run, verdict missing, some stages present but not all expected stages reached, warnings present without terminal failure.

**`failed`** — any of the following hold:

- run record exists but is malformed/unreadable
- `errors` array is non-empty
- a stage has `status: "failed"`
- `analysts_failed` is non-empty AND no completed arbiter verdict exists
- execution clearly terminated unsuccessfully

This three-state policy matches trace's existing derivation logic exactly (see `ops_trace.py` lines 226–233). The browser projection should use the same decision tree to keep the two surfaces semantically aligned.

### 6.3 Projection Field Mapping

| Browser field | Source path | Fallback |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| `run_id` | `run_record["run_id"]` (top-level) | Required — skip run if missing |
| `timestamp` | `run_record["timestamp"]` (top-level) | Required — skip run if missing |
| `instrument` | `run_record["request"]["instrument"]` | `null` if request block or field absent |
| `session` | `run_record["request"]["session"]` | `null` if request block or field absent |
| `final_decision` | `run_record["arbiter"]["verdict"]` when `arbiter["ran"] == true` | `null` if arbiter absent, not ran, or verdict missing |
| `run_status` | Derived per §6.2 | `"failed"` as conservative fallback for unclassifiable cases |
| `trace_available` | Derived per §6.3.1 | `false` as default |

#### 6.3.1 `trace_available` Derivation

`trace_available = true` when **all** of the following hold:

1. `run_record.json` exists in the run directory
2. File parses as valid JSON
3. `run_id` field is present
4. `timestamp` field is present

`trace_available` does **not** depend on arbiter verdict, stage completeness, or error state. A partial or failed run still has a useful trace — `trace_available` means "the trace endpoint can project something meaningful from this artifact," not "the run completed successfully."

### 6.4 `data_state` Semantics

| Value | Meaning | UI behavior |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `live` | Run directory scan completed successfully, all projected records parsed cleanly | Normal render |
| `stale` | Scan completed but some `run_record.json` files could not be parsed (skipped) | Render with stale indicator — count may be approximate |
| `unavailable` | Run directory could not be accessed | Browser-level error state |

### 6.5 Scan Discipline

The scan rules stay tight and in-family with existing bounded read-side services like Agent Detail's recent participation scanning (max 20 dirs / 7 days).

**Required rules:**

1. Scan only `ai_analyst/output/runs/`
2. Treat each immediate child directory as a candidate run
3. Inspect `run_record.json` only — do not recursively traverse artifact trees
4. Ignore junk directories safely (no `run_record.json` → skip, no crash)
5. Malformed individual runs must not crash the endpoint — skip or classify as `failed`
6. Max directories scanned: configurable, default 200, hard ceiling 500
7. If directory count exceeds max, scan the most recent N by directory modification time

**Processing sequence:**

1. Enumerate candidate directories (bounded)
2. Attempt projection from each `run_record.json`
3. Skip unreadable candidates or classify `failed` conservatively
4. Apply filters on projected `instrument` / `session`
5. Sort by parsed timestamp descending
6. Paginate the projected list
7. Return page slice with `total` (post-filter count) and `has_next`

### 6.6 Frontend — `RunBrowserPanel` Component

**Behavior:**

1. On mount, fetches `GET /runs/` with default parameters (page 1, page_size 20, no filters)
2. Renders a compact list of `RunBrowserItem` entries — displayed columns: timestamp, instrument, session, final_decision, run_status
3. **Click-to-load:** clicking a row calls the existing `onSelectRun` handler, which triggers `useAgentTrace(run_id)` to load the full trace. Rows where `trace_available == false` are visually de-emphasized or disabled.
4. **Filter controls:** instrument and session dropdowns
5. **Pagination:** next/prev page controls with `has_next` gating
6. **Loading / empty / error states:** consistent with Phase 6/7 patterns (LoadingSkeleton, EmptyState, ErrorState)

**Integration with existing Run mode:**

`RunBrowserPanel` becomes the **primary** run selector. The existing paste-field `RunSelector` is demoted to a secondary input — a "Go to run ID" shortcut alongside the browsable list. Both use the same `onSelectRun` callback (confirmed from `AgentOpsPage.tsx` line 114: `handleSelectRun` → `setSelectedRunId`).

Layout:
```

```

**TanStack Query hook:**

```typescript
function useRuns(params: {
  page?: number;
  pageSize?: number;
  instrument?: string | null;
  session?: string | null;
}): UseQueryResult<RunBrowserResponse>
```

Stale time: 30 seconds.

## 8. Pre-Code Diagnostic Protocol

**Do not implement until this list is reviewed.**

> **Note:** The diagnostic has already been run and approved (see §13). The protocol below is preserved for reproducibility. If re-running, use the corrected paths from §13.

### Step 1: Confirm run artifact structure

```bash
# List available run directories
ls -la ai_analyst/output/runs/ | head -20

# Inspect the fixture (run directory is currently empty)
cat tests/fixtures/sample_run_record.json | python -m json.tool
```

**Expected result:** Fixture contains top-level keys: `run_id`, `timestamp`, `duration_ms`, `request`, `stages`, `analysts`, `analysts_skipped`, `analysts_failed`, `arbiter`, `artifacts`, `usage_summary`, `warnings`, `errors`.

**Report:**
- Full top-level key list
- Confirm `request.instrument` and `request.session` paths
- Confirm `arbiter.ran` and `arbiter.verdict` paths
- Confirm `errors`, `warnings`, `analysts_failed` arrays exist
- Confirm `stages[]` structure and that status values are `"ok"` or `"failed"`
- Count total run directories on disk (expect: 0 — empty, `.gitkeep` only)
- Note that all tests must use temp dirs with fixture copies

### Step 2: Confirm trace projection reference

```bash
# Find the trace projection service
find ai_analyst/api/ -name "*trace*" -o -name "*ops_trace*" | head -10

# Inspect how it reads run_record.json
grep -n "run_record\|instrument\|session\|arbiter\|verdict\|ran\|errors" ai_analyst/api/services/ops_trace.py | head -30
```

**Expected result:** `ai_analyst/api/services/ops_trace.py` parses the same fields the browser needs.

**Report:**
- Exact file path of trace projection service
- How it extracts instrument, session, verdict — confirm key paths match §6.3
- Confirm trace uses three-value run_status: `completed | partial | failed`
- Whether `trace_available` can be derived from: JSON parseable + `run_id` present + `timestamp` present
- Confirm no shared parsing helper exists — browser reads independently

### Step 3: Confirm current RunSelector component

```bash
# Find the existing RunSelector
find ui/src -name "*RunSelector*" | head -10

# Inspect its interface
head -50 ui/src/workspaces/ops/components/RunSelector.tsx
```

**Expected result:** `RunSelector` with `onSelectRun: (runId: string | null) => void` callback.

**Report:**
- Exact file path and props interface
- How it currently triggers trace loading
- Confirm the browser panel can use the same `onSelectRun` callback

### Step 4: Confirm Agent Ops Run mode wiring

```bash
# Inspect how Run mode is wired
grep -n "Run\|mode\|trace\|selector\|RunSelector" ui/src/workspaces/ops/components/AgentOpsPage.tsx | head -20
```

**Expected result:** Run mode renders `<RunSelector>` then `<RunTracePanel>`, gated by mode state.

**Report:**
- How the mode pill activates Run mode
- Where RunSelector is rendered (expect: lines 230–252)
- Confirm `handleSelectRun` callback at line 114
- How to insert RunBrowserPanel above RunSelector with visual demotion

### Step 5: Run baseline test suite

```bash
# Backend tests (full suite)
python -m pytest tests/ -q --tb=no

# Frontend tests (full suite)
cd ui && npx vitest run --reporter=verbose 2>&1 | tail -20
```

**Expected result:** Ops-domain tests all pass. Record exact counts and note any pre-existing failures outside ops.

**Report:**
- Total backend test count and pass/fail split
- Ops-specific backend count (expect ~197 pass)
- Total frontend test count and pass/fail split
- Ops-specific frontend count (expect ~63 pass)
- List any pre-existing failures (expect: MDO scheduler + journey freeze related, not ops)

### Step 6: Propose smallest patch set

Based on findings from Steps 1–5, propose:

- Files to create (with one-line description and estimated line delta)
- Files to modify (with one-line description and estimated line delta)
- Files with "no changes expected" confirmation
- Total estimated line delta
- Any assumption corrections from the diagnostic

**Smallest safe option:** If a field turns out to be deeply nested or unreliable, drop it from v1 rather than adding complex parsing. The contract marks nullable fields for this reason. The browser adapts to the artifact, not the other way around.

**No premature abstraction:** Do not create a generic artifact scanner, shared parse helper extracted from trace, generalized run repository class, or cross-service refactor. One service, one model, one router, one panel, one hook, one API helper, tests. That's it.

---

## 9. Implementation Constraints

### 9.1 General rule

The browser endpoint is a **read-side projection over existing artifacts**. It reads `run_record.json` from disk, projects a compact summary, and returns it. No writes, no mutations, no new storage. Same philosophy as Phase 7's trace and detail endpoints.

### 9.1b Implementation Sequence

1. **Backend projection service** — create `ops_run_browser.py` that scans run directories, reads `run_record.json`, and projects `RunBrowserItem` summaries per §6.2 and §6.3
   - Verify: baseline ops backend tests still pass (197)

2. **Backend models** — create `ops_run_browser.py` Pydantic models for the browser response
   - Verify: models import cleanly

3. **Backend endpoint + route** — create `routers/runs.py` with `GET /runs/`, register in `main.py`
   - Verify: baseline + new endpoint tests pass

4. **Backend contract tests** — write deterministic tests covering AC-1 through AC-21, using temp dirs with fixture copies
   - Gate: all backend tests pass before touching frontend

5. **Frontend API + hook** — add `fetchRuns()` in `ui/src/shared/api/runs.ts` and `useRuns()` in `ui/src/shared/hooks/useRuns.ts`
   - Verify: frontend build compiles clean

6. **Frontend `RunBrowserPanel`** — implement the browsable run list component at `ui/src/workspaces/ops/components/RunBrowserPanel.tsx`
   - Verify: component tests pass (AC-22 through AC-29)

7. **Frontend integration** — wire `RunBrowserPanel` into `AgentOpsPage.tsx` Run mode above `RunSelector`, demote paste-field visually
   - Gate: all frontend tests pass (baseline 63 + new)
   - Verify: AC-30 (paste-field still works as fallback)

8. **Full regression** — run complete backend + frontend suites
   - Gate: ops-domain zero regressions (AC-36); pre-existing non-ops failure count does not increase

### 9.2 Code change surface

**New files:**

| File | Role | Est. lines |
|------|------|-----------|
| `ai_analyst/api/services/ops_run_browser.py` | Scan + read + project run summaries | ~150 |
| `ai_analyst/api/models/ops_run_browser.py` | Pydantic models for browser response | ~50 |
| `ai_analyst/api/routers/runs.py` | `GET /runs/` endpoint | ~55 |
| `tests/test_run_browser_endpoints.py` | Backend contract tests (AC-1 through AC-21) | ~250 |
| `ui/src/shared/api/runs.ts` | `fetchRuns()` API function | ~25 |
| `ui/src/shared/hooks/useRuns.ts` | TanStack Query hook | ~20 |
| `ui/src/workspaces/ops/components/RunBrowserPanel.tsx` | Browser panel component | ~160 |
| `ui/tests/run-browser.test.tsx` | Frontend component tests (AC-22 through AC-30) | ~180 |

**Modified files:**

| File | Change | Est. delta |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `ai_analyst/api/main.py` | Register `runs` router | +3 |
| `ui/src/workspaces/ops/components/AgentOpsPage.tsx` | Wire RunBrowserPanel, demote paste-field | +25 |

**No changes expected to:**
- `ai_analyst/api/routers/ops.py` — existing ops endpoints unchanged
- `ai_analyst/api/services/ops_trace.py` — trace service unchanged
- `ai_analyst/api/services/ops_detail.py` — detail service unchanged
- `ai_analyst/api/services/ops_health.py` — health service unchanged
- `ai_analyst/api/services/ops_roster.py` — roster service unchanged
- `run_record.json` artifacts — format unchanged
- `ui/vite.config.ts` — `/runs` proxy already configured
- Any Phase 6 workspace components

**Scope flag:** If `run_record.json` parsing reveals the need to modify the artifact format, flag before proceeding. The browser adapts to the artifact, not the other way around.

### 9.3 Out of scope (repeat + negative scope lock)

**Hard constraints:**
- No SQLite or database layer introduced
- No new top-level module — work confined to `ai_analyst/api/` and `ui/`
- No changes to existing Agent Ops endpoints or trace endpoint
- No `run_record.json` format changes
- No scheduler integration — reads stored data only
- No WebSocket / SSE / live-push
- Deterministic fixture/mock tests only — no live pipeline dependency in CI

**No premature abstraction:**
- No generic "artifact scanner" module
- No shared parse helper extracted from trace
- No generalized run repository class
- No cross-service refactor in PR-RUN-1

**PR-RUN-1 does not:**
- Add search
- Add sort toggles beyond newest-first default
- Add artifact preview or download
- Add reflect data aggregation
- Add chart binding
- Refactor trace service
- Unify all run-reading logic into a shared framework

## 10. Success Definition

PR-RUN-1 is done when: the `GET /runs/` endpoint (registered in its own `routers/runs.py`) returns a paginated, filterable index of run summaries projected from `run_record.json` artifacts on disk; `run_status` is derived deterministically per the three-value policy aligned with trace (`completed | partial | failed`); `final_decision` is gated on `arbiter.ran == true`; `trace_available` is `true` when the artifact exists, parses as JSON, and contains `run_id` + `timestamp`; the `RunBrowserPanel` frontend component renders this list in Agent Ops Run mode as the primary run selector; clicking a run loads its trace; the paste-field remains as a fallback; all 36 acceptance criteria pass with deterministic tests using temp dirs and fixture copies; no regressions in existing ops-domain tests (197 backend + 63 frontend); no SQLite, no new top-level module, no artifact format changes, no premature abstraction.

## 11. Why This Phase Matters

| Without Run Browser | With Run Browser |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Operator must know the exact `run_id` to inspect a run | Operator browses recent runs and clicks to inspect |
| Run discovery requires terminal access or log searching | Run discovery is in-product, filterable by instrument and session |
| Agent Ops Run mode is effectively unusable without external context | Run mode is self-contained — browse → select → inspect |
| No feedback on whether a run's trace is loadable before clicking | `trace_available` prevents dead-end clicks |
| Chart and Reflect features (Phase 8 Weeks 2–6) have no discoverable run substrate | Charts and Reflect can reference runs the operator has already browsed |

---

## 12. Phase Roadmap

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Phase 7 — Agent Ops read-side stack | 4 endpoints, 3 workspace modes, detail sidebar | ✅ Done — 197 backend + 63 frontend tests |
| **PR-RUN-1 — Run Browser** | **`GET /runs/` endpoint + RunBrowserPanel frontend** | **⏳ Spec drafted — implementation pending** |
| PR-CHART-1 — OHLCV data seam + chart | Candlestick chart in Run mode | 📋 Planned — depends on PR-RUN-1 |
| PR-CHART-2 — Run context overlay | Multi-timeframe, run marker, verdict annotation | 📋 Planned — depends on PR-CHART-1 |
| PR-REFLECT-1 — Aggregation endpoints | Persona performance + pattern summary | 📋 Planned — depends on PR-RUN-1 |
| PR-REFLECT-2 — Reflect dashboard | `/reflect` workspace frontend (new top-level workspace) | 📋 Planned — depends on PR-REFLECT-1 |
| PR-REFLECT-3 — Integration + suggestions | Chart ↔ run + rules-based parameter suggestions | 📋 Planned — depends on PR-CHART-2 + PR-REFLECT-2 |

## 13. Diagnostic Findings

Diagnostic run completed 15 March 2026. Key findings:

**Path corrections from spec hypotheses:**

| Spec hypothesis | Actual path |
|----------------|-------------|
| `app/services/ops/trace_projection.py` | `ai_analyst/api/services/ops_trace.py` |
| `app/routes/` | `ai_analyst/api/routers/` |
| `app/services/` | `ai_analyst/api/services/` |
| `app/models/` | `ai_analyst/api/models/` |
| `app/main.py` | `ai_analyst/api/main.py` |
| `ui/src/components/ops/RunSelector.tsx` | `ui/src/workspaces/ops/components/RunSelector.tsx` |
| `ui/src/pages/AgentOpsPage.tsx` | `ui/src/workspaces/ops/components/AgentOpsPage.tsx` |

**Artifact shape:** All §6.3 field mappings confirmed against `tests/fixtures/sample_run_record.json`. Stage status values are `"ok"` or `"failed"`.

**Run directory:** Currently empty — all tests use temp dirs with fixture copies.

**Trace alignment:** Trace uses three-value `run_status` (`completed | partial | failed`). Browser aligns. Fourth state (`unknown`) dropped per review.

**`trace_available`:** Derived from: JSON parseable + `run_id` present + `timestamp` present. Does not depend on arbiter or stage state.

**RunSelector callback:** `onSelectRun: (runId: string | null) => void` — browser panel uses same callback.

**Vite proxy:** `/runs` already configured — no config change needed.

**Baseline:** 197 ops backend + 63 ops frontend tests green. 9 pre-existing backend failures (MDO scheduler), 5 pre-existing frontend failures (journey freeze) — all outside ops domain.

## 14. Doc Corrections to Apply on Branch

On the PR-RUN-1 branch, apply these corrections to keep plan docs consistent:

1. **`PHASE_8_PLAN.md` §Week 1 scope:** Change "read `run_record.json` headers only (run_id, instrument, session, status, timestamp, final_decision)" to "read `run_record.json` and project compact run summaries from the real artifact shape (run_id, timestamp, request.instrument, request.session, arbiter.verdict, derived run_status)"

2. **`PHASE_8_PLAN.md` §Reflect placement:** Resolve "New Reflect workspace (or tab within Agent Ops)" to "New top-level `/reflect` workspace" — locked decision per PR-RUN-1 spec §12.

---

## 15. Appendix — Recommended Agent Prompt

```
Read `docs/specs/PR_RUN_1_SPEC.md` in full before starting.
Treat it as the controlling spec for this pass.

The diagnostic (§13) has been completed and approved. Path corrections are
already applied in the spec. You may skip re-running the diagnostic protocol
unless you find discrepancies — in that case, report before proceeding.

Implementation sequence per §9.1b:

1. Backend projection service (ops_run_browser.py) — scan + project
2. Backend models (ops_run_browser.py models)
3. Backend endpoint (routers/runs.py) + register in main.py
4. Backend contract tests (test_run_browser_endpoints.py) — AC-1 through AC-21
   Gate: all backend tests pass before touching frontend
5. Frontend API + hook (runs.ts + useRuns.ts)
6. Frontend RunBrowserPanel component
7. Frontend integration in AgentOpsPage.tsx — wire browser, demote paste-field
   Gate: all frontend tests pass (baseline 63 + new)
8. Full regression — ops-domain zero regressions

Hard constraints:
- Browser endpoint is a read-side projection — no writes, no mutations, no new storage
- No SQLite, no database, no index file
- No new top-level module — work in ai_analyst/api/ and ui/ only
- No changes to existing ops endpoints, trace endpoint, or run_record.json format
- run_status uses three-value policy aligned with trace: completed | partial | failed
  Do not introduce a fourth state without a concrete failing test case
- final_decision gated on arbiter.ran == true — not on arbiter block existence alone
- trace_available = true when: JSON parseable + run_id present + timestamp present
  Do not gate on arbiter verdict or stage completeness
- No premature abstraction: no generic artifact scanner, no shared parse helper
  extracted from trace, no run repository class, no cross-service refactor
- Deterministic fixture/mock tests only — all tests use temp dirs with fixture copies
- If run_record.json parsing requires format changes, flag before proceeding

GET /runs/ is a top-level run-discovery surface. Register it in routers/runs.py,
NOT in routers/ops.py.

On completion, close the spec and update docs per Workflow E:
1. `docs/specs/PR_RUN_1_SPEC.md` — mark ✅ Complete, flip all 36 AC cells,
   update §13 with: final patch set with line deltas, any implementation
   surprises, test count delta
2. `docs/AI_TradeAnalyst_Progress.md` — dashboard-aware update per Workflow E.2:
   update header, add Recent Activity row, update Phase Index,
   add test count row, update Roadmap (PR-RUN-1 → ✅ Done),
   update §6 Immediate Next Actions
3. Apply doc corrections from §14 (PHASE_8_PLAN.md updates)
4. Review `system_architecture.md`, `repo_map.md`, `technical_debt.md`,
   `AI_ORIENTATION.md` — update only if this phase changed architecture,
   structure, or debt state
5. Cross-document sanity check: no contradictions, no stale phase refs
6. Return Phase Completion Report (see Workflow E.8)

Commit all doc changes on the same branch as the implementation.
